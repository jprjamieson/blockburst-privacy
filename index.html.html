    <h1>Privacy Policy for Block Burst</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 27 February 2026</p>

    <p>JP Jamieson ("we", "our", or "us") built Block Burst as a free, ad-supported game. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Block Burst does not directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All game data (scores, settings, progress) is stored locally on your device and is never sent to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These services have their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. This may include device identifiers, IP address, and usage data for the purpose of serving personalised or non-personalised ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> — Required for app distribution and updates. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>Block Burst displays banner, interstitial, and rewarded video advertisements provided by Google AdMob. On first launch, you will be presented with a consent prompt (where required by law) to choose whether you receive personalised or non-personalised ads.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Block Burst is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through a third-party service, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no data retained on our end. Game progress stored locally on your device can be deleted by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all game data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete all data by uninstalling the app. For data collected by third-party services (AdMob), please refer to their respective privacy policies for information on exercising your rights.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
